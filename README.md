# DashBoard_PowerBI
A management report on a juice store with data created, the data frames used were taken from Alura's class on PowerBI. Its objective is to show the power of the tool and the ease of its use on a daily basis for decision making.

The repository file contains all the data used in the dashboard itself that can be opened in powerBI of the same version and also a PDF if you just want to see the final result. Unfortunately to put the report on the web you need to have PowerBI PRO which I don't have at the moment.
